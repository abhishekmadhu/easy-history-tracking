# Export History Tracking Button - Requirements and Solution Approach

## Requirement

**Goal:**
Create a reusable Lightning Web Component (LWC) button labeled "Export". When clicked, this button will generate a CSV file and prompt the user to download it. The button will be integrated into the existing `displayObjects` component.

**CSV Format:**
The generated CSV file must have the following columns:

- Object Label
- Object API Name
- Field Label
- Field API Name
- History Tracking? ("true" if history tracking is enabled for the field, otherwise "false")

**Details:**

- The button component should be named appropriately (e.g., `exportHistoryButton`).
- The button label must be "Export".
- On click, the button will generate a CSV file with the above format (the data source and structure to be defined in the integration step).
- The user should be prompted to download the generated CSV file. Use standard browser functionality to initiate the download automatically.
- The button should be reusable and easily embeddable in other components.
- The button must be added to the `displayObjects` component UI.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The button is visible in the `displayObjects` component.
- Clicking the button generates and downloads a CSV file.
- The button is implemented as a separate LWC for reusability.
- The solution works in Salesforce Lightning Experience.

## Solution Approach

1. **Button Component (LWC):**
   - Create a new LWC (e.g., `exportHistoryButton`).
   - The component renders a button with the label "Export".
   - On click, the component generates a CSV file in the format specified above (initially with sample data or structure, to be integrated with real data as needed).
   - Use JavaScript to create a Blob and trigger a download in the browser.
   - Make the component reusable by exposing a public method or property for data input.

2. **Integration with displayObjects:**
   - Import and include the `exportHistoryButton` component in the `displayObjects` component's template.
   - Pass the relevant data (including object and field details, and history tracking status) to the export button for CSV generation.
   - To avoid Salesforce SOQL row limits, the export logic will query fields per object if a list of object API names is provided. If no filter is provided, the export will return up to 2000 fields across all objects (Salesforce platform limitation). Users are encouraged to select/filter objects for large orgs.

3. **Testing:**
   - Verify that the button appears and functions as expected in the UI.
   - Confirm that the downloaded CSV file contains the correct data and format, including the "History Tracking?" column.
   - Ensure the solution works in supported browsers and Salesforce Lightning Experience.

4. **Documentation:**
   - Document the usage of the export button component and its integration steps.
